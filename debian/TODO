TODO list for dietlibc in Debian
--------------------------------

Bugs:

 - investigate SSP-caused test failure of tst-calloc.c on
   PowerPC (32 and 64 bit) platforms

Package features:

 - reenable dynamic linking support on architectures
   that support it
 - enable PIE support in dietlibc once that's supported upstream
